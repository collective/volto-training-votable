Mastering Plone Development training â€“ Volto add-on for the votable behavior

`volto-training-votable` provides the code for voting components for a Volto app.
It is the counter part of the Plone backend add-on [`training.votable` ](https://github.com/collective/training.votable) which provides the behavior code for voting on arbitrary content type instances by authenticated users.

`volto-training-votable` and `training.votable` are part of the training story of 'Mastering Plone Development' on [training.plone.org/mastering-plone](https://training.plone.org/mastering-plone/eggs2.html).
